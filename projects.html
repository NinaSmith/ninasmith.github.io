		<img  class="myImg" src="images/z.png" alt="WINNER: 3rd Place Overall UGAHacks<br>World Tour Z is a VR exercise game that progresses through a zombie clown infested apocalypse by means of a stationary bike. The game registers how fast a player pedals and the bike in game will speed up or slow down accordingly. The game uses a Vive controller attached to a players foot and second control that equips players with a .45 that they can use to take care of pesky undead clowns. Each clip only has 10 rounds, so a player must reach to their side to reload. Players can also look down at their bike screen to keep up with their stats. This game was created in 36 hours."/>
